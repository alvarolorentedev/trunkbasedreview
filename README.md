# Trunk-Based Review

async peer reviewing for trunk-based development

## Motivation

Pull Requests seem to be a norm for many professionals in the software development business. Nevertheless, git flow is deemed legacy. This means there is a disconnection in between the preferred/know used peer review system and  modern practices.

Trunk-Based review tries to bridge this for teams that don't want or are unable to adapt to other modern agile peer review models like pair programming.

## How it works

While you do [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) and follow best practices like branching by abstraction and feature toggles.

Peers will comment on the `main branch` code level, and discussions can happen on the fly. This can happen for example in the issues' functionality of GitHub. Conversations and changes should happen the same way they do in the Merge Requests.

# Benefits

- complying with the concept of continuous integration due to the immediate integration of code.
- Faster feedback loop on code changes.
- Smaller changes that help reduce MTTR.
